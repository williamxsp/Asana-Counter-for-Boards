# Asana-Counter-for-Boards

Greasemonkey script for Asana to sum up numbers in brackets for selected tasks.

Emulates the behavior of the similar hack that was removed from Asana some time ago:

## How to use:
Get Greasemonkey (or Tampermonkey if you use Chrome)  plugin;

Install the script;

Reload the Asana;

Great! The sum will appear at the columns title


Examples of expected numbers format in tasks:

- task [42] nice
- task [42] nice
- task[3.14]
- [-1] task
